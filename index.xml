In this blogpost I want to talk about the concept of AR duality. In short AR duality says that in suitably nice abelian categories we have natural isomorphisms $$\underline{\Hom}(\tau^- Y, X) \cong D\Ext^1(X, Y) \cong \overline{\Hom}(Y, \tau X)$$ Where $\underline{\Hom}$ is the stable homfunctor, $\overline{\Hom}$ is the costable homfunctor and $\tau$ is the Auslander-Reiten translate. In this blogpost I will define what these things mean and try to give an outline of the proof.</description>

      <title>Cogroups and Groups of Schemes</title>

Introduction I was watching Richard E. Borchards lecture series on schemes where he talked about groups in the category of schemes. Thinking about this I stumbled upon the idea of cogroups. I was already vaguely familiar with the idea of coalgebras, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked at cogroups before (or so I thought). So this blogpost will just be my ramblings of what I found out.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Polynomial Rings</title>

Inspired by Ravi Vakil&amp;rsquo;s summer project about algebraic geometry I wanted to make this blog post about the spectrum of polynomial rings and how to conceptualize them geometrically when your field isn&amp;rsquo;t algebraically closed.
The spectrum of a ring $R$, denoted $\Spec R$, is the set of all prime ideals of $R$ (with some additional structure). We think of a $\Spec R$ as a geometric space where the points are the maximal ideals, and the prime ideals contained in a maximal ideal represent geometric objects containing the point.</description>

Recently I learned about Kan extension which is a generalization of (co)limits in category theory. So I thought it would be fun to write a little blog post introducing limits and Kan extensions. The idea of a (co)limit is to capture information about a diagram in just one object. The idea of Kan extensions is similar, but instead of trying to capture information in a single object we do it in some other diagram.</description>
