Introduction I was watching Richard E. Borchards lecture series on schemes where he talked about groups in the category of schemes. Thinking about this I stumbled upon the idea of cogroups. I was already vaguely familiar with the idea of coalgebras, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really looked at cogroups before (or so I thought). So this blogpost will just be my ramblings of what I found out.</description>

Inspired by Ravi Vakil&amp;rsquo;s summer project about algebraic geometry I wanted to make this blog post about the spectrum of polynomial rings and how to conceptualize them geometrically when your field isn&amp;rsquo;t algebraically closed.
The spectrum of a ring $R$, denoted $\Spec R$, is the set of all prime ideals of $R$ (with some additional structure). We think of a $\Spec R$ as a geometric space where the points are the maximal ideals, and the prime ideals contained in a maximal ideal represent geometric objects containing the point.</description>
